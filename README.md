About gem: **Simple design ready blog for your rails application**

**Add to your Gemfile:**

```ruby
gem 'blogg'
```

**create 'config/initializers/blogg.rb' and set class with devise authorization and other settings:**

```ruby
require 'blogg'
Blogg.setup do |config|
  # Your Class with devise authorization, default is "User"
  # config.user_class = "Admin"

  # It shows at the top navbar
  # config.brand_text = "Blogg"

  # Your awesome blog name
  # config.blog_title = "The Blogg"

  # Your awesome blog description
  # config.blog_description = "Awesome Blog for awesome People"

  # Footer text, can contain html and #{ruby code}
  # config.footer_text = "Copyright Â© My Blog #{Date.today.year}""
